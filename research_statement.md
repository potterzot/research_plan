Field and Areas of Interest
---------------------------

My field of primary interest is environmental and natural resource
economics and econometric methods of causal inference in that context.
I'm specifically interested in the implications of scarce resources for
social welfare, global trade, and market power. My research to date has
focused on three areas: (1) extending methods to evaluate the effects of
climate on agriculture and natural resource production, (2) bayesian
estimation of freshwater availability and its implications for global
trade, and (3) field experiments to examine the implications of culture
on farmer attitudes toward environmental conservation programs.

My work in these areas is informed by an interest in reproducible
research methods, the replicability crisis, and science communication.
These are crucial issues that directly impact the quality of my research
and the quality of, and therefore trust in, science in general.

Research Agenda
---------------

**Climate effects on agriculture and natural resource production:**
Climate projections provide a view of future climate in the U.S., but
the effects of projected climate remain unknown. Previous efforts have
allowed for farmer adaptation but have assumed linear responses
(Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, and Shaw [1994](#ref-MendelsohnNordhausShaw1994))
or have kept crop types fixed and allowed for non-linear temperature
responses to crops (Schlenker and Roberts
[2009](#ref-SchlenkerRoberts2009)). Working with Michael Brady and Kirti
Rajagopalan, I am developing a methodology to match future climate
locations to the most analogous current climate location and estimate
future agricultural value. This allows for both non-linear yield
responses to temperature as well as farmer adaptation by switching to
more climate-appropriate crops as the climate changes.

**Market mechanisms when costs are private and heterogeneous:** Building
on Apesteguia ([2006](#ref-Apesteguia2006)), Ana Arrandendo-Espanola and
I develop a model of a common pool resource in which firm costs are
private and non-homogeneous, and payoffs are not well known. Hence
uncertainty is reflected in firm cost and payoff evaluations. This
increased uncertainty leads to different responses based on the risk
profile of different firms, a difference larger firms can exploit to
eliminate smaller firms.

**Freshwater availability and global trade:** One way of thinking about
water at global scales is in terms of embedded water: the water needed
to produce the output of an area's economy. The concept of embedded
water allows for estimation of global water trade flows. These trade
flows are significantly affected by freshwater availability, which can
serve as a comparative advantage (Debaere [2014](#ref-Debaere2014)).
Following Dang, Lin, and Konar ([2015](#ref-DangLinKonar2015)), I
examine embedded water flows in the United States and how those flows
have changed in response to periods of drought.

**Water scarcity and human conflict:** Work by Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel
([2013](#ref-HsiangBurkeMiguel2013)) suggests that precipitation has a
U-shaped impact on human conflict. Both too little and too much water
can increase the likelihood of conflict. More can be done to look at the
availability of water, how that will change in the future, and what we
can do to best manage it.

**Causal inference and issues of statistical significance:** This is
less well defined but here I hope to build on recent work by Susan Athey
and others (see for example Athey and Imbens
[2017](#ref-AtheyImbens2017); Tran et al. [2016](#ref-TranETAL2016))
incorporating bayesian statistics and machine learning into causal
inference. This is motivated partially by discussions around the "crisis
of significance" in social science discussed by Gelman and Loken
([2013](#ref-GelmanLoken2013)), and thoughts such as those in the
classic paper by Leamer ([2010](#ref-Leamer2010)).

**Network effects, culture, and attitudes toward environmental
conservation:** Minority farmers in the United States take advantage of
USDA conservation programs at disproportionately low rates. There are
several potential mechanisms that may explain this discrepancy,
including lack of awareness, distrust of government, and differences in
land ownership. Hayley Chouinard, Michael Brady, Phillip Wandschneider,
and I are implementing a randomized controlled trial in which the
treatment is a mailing emphasizing individual, social, or environmental
benefits of the USDA conservation programs.

By combining the results from that field experiment with administrative
records on payments to farmers as part of conservation programs, I use a
proximity-based social network model to evaluate characteristics of
minority farmer networks and examine whether networks play a significant
role in program participation.

Methodology
-----------

My methodological focus is causal inference. In working with issues of
climate or future projections, I use matching algorithms to create
balanced treatment and control groups and estimate treatment effects for
future effects.

Data
----

Much of my research makes use of large-scale geographically located data
on natural resources, agriculture, and historical and projected climate.
This is data that is expanding rapidly in both resolution and breadth
and offers a rich field for analysis that was previously impossible. I
make significant use of cluster computing to process high-resolution
data sets. Post GIS allows for distributed analysis over geographical
space with datasets that contains millions of objects.

Future Directions
-----------------

My future research builds on current efforts and is likely to fall into
three areas: (1) statistical validity of climate impacts and
incorporating bayesian and machine learning methods to improve
identification in causal inference, (2) distortionary effects of market
power when resources are scarce, and (3) collaborative economies as a
response to scarcity.

In the first case, strong causal inference in complex systems is
difficult. Machine learning methods provide improved prediction of
counterfactuals, and important perspectives on model generalizability.
Probabilistic outcomes under a bayesian framework provide a method for
explicitly incorporating uncertainty. Both of these tools are
particularly useful in the context of high-resolution global data on
climate and natural resources.

For questions of how resource scarcity affects societies, an important
factor is the degree of centralization of control over that resource.
Natural disasters disproportionately affect those without the resources
to take preventative action, and the same is true when resources are
scarce. I aim to explore how the distribution of economic power in
situations of scarcity affects outcomes.

Lastly, one way that societies respond to scarcity is by developing
mechanisms to enforce mutually beneficial actions. While much of the
work on collaborative economies to date has focused on motivation and
benefit to individuals, collaborative economies also can be interpreted
as a group-level response to managing scarcity. This may suggest new
mechanisms and frameworks for the management of natural resources and
resource scarcity.
